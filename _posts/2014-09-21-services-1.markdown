title: Why this project

There are many reasons why I started this project. On one hand people can happily rely on EBS MCS webservices to run e.g., a POS. But this is not the goal of this project. I have a vision for the e-payment ecosystem in Sudan, way more beyond the 1SDG purchase fees.

• a middleware for a many is major entry burden. Well, you have a free one now.

• having a strong e-payment ecosystem will benefit all of us.

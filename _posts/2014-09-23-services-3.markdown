• a mobile application app (with its backend system, obviously). This app will encapsulates the business logic and authenticate the incoming requests.

• a chatting service. Like WeChat, where people can send their money to their friends and families, in a very friendly way.

• ecommerce platform. The idea is not just to offer an epayment gateway, well, EBS offers that through their MCS web services.

• and finally the payment gateway layer which handles the payment part.

• there could be other services e.g., push notifications, SMS, 2FA and plenty of others.

• logging and the reporting system.

• rate limiting, geographical blocking and other API gateway protections.
